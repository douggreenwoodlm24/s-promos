# SabreStatic

Static site helper for Sabre

From a Git bash window:

**npm install** to install grunt + plugins (will need node.js installed first -- Node 4.x.x fine for this)

(May need to do **npm install -g grunt-cli** if installing grunt for the first time)

then

Use **grunt bs** to fire up browser sync with local server + grunt watch for JS and SCSS. Default browser should auto open and open a directory listing of /site/ with a few demo pages... if not go to **http://localhost:3000/**
